======================================
Accounting Financial Report Horizontal
======================================

This module offers trial_balance report defined in account_financial_report 
in landscape mode.
Up to version 11 it was an extension of the profit/loss sheet in odoo core.
Now after the removal of such reports it is an extension of
trial balance report in account_financial_report that allows us to 
show the report in Horizontal mode.

Usage
=====

The trial balance wizards will be provided with a checkbox "horizontal mode" 
that will allow print and export to be done automatically in horizontal mode.
